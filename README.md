## <a name="history-of-internet">Breif Historty of the Internet</a>
- To be able to fully appreciate the sheer magnatude of what Jsoup is allowing us to do, we need to take a brief tour through the history of the internet. Not including birds and horses, the first real means of communication was the Telegraph.

 ### Telegraph
 - Created in 1844, it is hard to put into words how revolutionary the Telegraph was. Prior to the Telegraph, The United states of America had the famed [Pony Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Express) to deliver information. At it's peak, the Pony Express could devilver information from one side of the United States to the other in 10 days. If you follow the data conversions provided [HERE](https://eager.io/blog/communication-pre-internet/) under the Pony Express section, we get a data transmission rate of about 6 bits per second. Of course this does not include the latency issues that riding horses coast to coast would invoke, so in reality it would be much slower.
  - When the Telegraph was put into use, data transmistion became almost instant and the death of the Pony Express became definite. The Telegraph  used dots and dashes(simular to binary) to communicate information from one station to another. The first message sent was the incredibly melencoly quote of, `WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT`, from the supreme court chamber in Washington, D.C, USA to a train station in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.


 ### ALOHAnet
 - Fast forward to 1971 and at the University of Hawaii ALOHAnet was created, which is argubaly the true grandfather of the internet. Born out of the need for the university to connect all of its campuses and influenced by the geographical hinderance of the campuses all being on different islands. These unique restrictions would ultimately lead to the worlds first wirelessly connected network. The technology an protocols developed for ALOHAnet are still used and influence most of what our modern virtual world runs on. Fun fact, ALOHAnet celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. So make sure to say happy birthday next times you use the internet :) .


### The internet
- In 1983, fuled by the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) we get the invention of the internet. Which at its most simplistic description is just a network of computers that have all agreed to communicate information in the same way. However, the internet was mostly used by researchers, academics and university students to share research material. The internet was essentialy unknown outside of the academic and research communities. The World Wide Web(What you and I think of as the internet) was invented by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. When we type in `WWW` into our browser, we are using the World Wide Web. Now, it is important to point out that the internet and the World Wide Web are two completly different things. The internet is the underlying technological infastructure that we use to send information from one computer to another. The World Wide Web is a collection of connected
